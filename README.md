### How to Run the Game
Run the newgame.rkt file in the directory using a Racket IDE.

### Game Rules
You are a spaceship attempting to stop enemies from crossing the screen boundary on the left (or colliding into you)! 
You have 5 Health points, and you lose one point every time an enemy gets past the left side of the screen or crashes into you.
Stay alive as long as you can while the enemies slowly speed up.

### How to Play the Game
Start the game with the Escape key, Move the ship with the arrow keys, double tap a direction to move at max speed in that direction, and fire projectiles with Space.
